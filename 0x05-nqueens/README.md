# 0x05. N Queens

## Overview

The "0x05. N Queens" project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, focusing on placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. Solving this problem requires understanding backtracking algorithms and recursion to explore all potential solutions efficiently.

## Key Concepts

### Backtracking Algorithms:

Backtracking algorithms are used to systematically search for solutions to a problem by trying different options and "backtracking" when a dead end is reached. For the N Queens problem, backtracking is essential to explore all possible queen placements while avoiding conflicts.

### Recursion:

Recursion plays a crucial role in implementing backtracking algorithms. Recursive functions are used to explore each possible placement of queens on the chessboard efficiently. Understanding recursion is fundamental to solving the N Queens problem effectively.

### List Manipulations in Python:

Python lists are commonly used to represent the chessboard and store the positions of queens. Manipulating lists is essential for placing queens, checking for conflicts, and backtracking. Familiarity with list operations and data structures in Python is necessary for implementing the N Queens solution.

### Python Command Line Arguments:

The solution for the N Queens problem may require accepting input parameters, such as the size of the chessboard, from the command line. Handling command-line arguments in Python, typically using the `sys` module, allows users to customize the behavior of the program and solve the problem for different board sizes.

## Project Structure

The project may consist of the following components:

1. **Main Algorithm Implementation**: Python script containing the implementation of the backtracking algorithm to solve the N Queens problem.
2. **Input Handling**: Code to accept command-line arguments specifying the size of the chessboard.
3. **Chessboard Representation**: Logic to represent the chessboard and manipulate queen positions using Python lists.
4. **Testing**: Test cases to validate the correctness and efficiency of the N Queens solution for different board sizes.

## Usage

To run the N Queens solver, execute the Python script with appropriate command-line arguments specifying the size of the chessboard. For example:

```bash
python n_queens_solver.py 8
